coupling - how much work is involved in changing something?

tightly coupled - need to change the class name each and every time if class names are hardcoded 

ONly thing constant in technology is change - business requirement, code changes , framework changes , so its better to use loose coupling as much as possible 

use use java interface and spring framework to help in loose coupling 

gamerclass - gamingconsole(interface) - all classes that implements gamingconsole
